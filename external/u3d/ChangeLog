1.4.4 05.2013
disabled use of assembler, since performance gain is likely small, while portability risks high
fixed warnings of unused variable values (when it was unclear if there was an error or a desired behavior,
the current behavior was preserved). 
changed cmake build not to use bundled libraries by default
updated jpeg, png and zlib libraries

1.4.3 02.2012
fixed MSVC Win64 bit compilation - reported by Ingo Wulf
updated jpeg, png and zlib libraries

1.4.2 05.2011
fixed Win32 compilation with __stdcall set in IFXAPI.h - reported by Rob Ebbers
put vtkU3DExporter to the code samples section
added headers to program and library sources in cmake, so they are correctly shown in MSVC GUI.
made libIDTF shared library (but for MSVC)
(there were problems on Linux with PIC if static libIDTF was used to build shared libraries)

1.4.1 04.2011
changes in IDTFConverter, to allow it to parse Adobe metadata for nodes
MinGW compilation

1.4.0 02.2011
Many tiny fixes, but I do not remember what are they

1.3.0 2009-2010
Repackaged Intel sources from custom build system to autotools and cmake
Fixed lots of compilation warnings, may be bugs.
Dropped everything but parts required to create U3D files (i.e. Renderind component and sample Player).
Set default compression parameters to minimal compression.
Made libIDTF from converter part of IDTFConverter, so that instead of making huge IDTF files
on disk and launching IDFConverter one can create equivalent binary scene in memory
and call "convert" routine

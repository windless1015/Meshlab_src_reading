If GNU Build System is used,
then the usual ./configure; make; make install must work.
Debug output may be enable with (surprise!) --enable-debug configure option.
Optional bootstrap  is also here.
PNG and JPEG libraies are necessary to compile and run.

If cmake is used (Mac-only option for now),
then
 cmake . ; make; make install
must result  in largely the same as GBS system-wide install.

If
 cmake -DSTATIC=ON .
is used, then the library is installed into Build subdirectory,
depends on sytem libaraies only, has PNG and JPEG code compiled in
and assumes that IFXCore.so and Plugins directory are in the current directory
or in the directory set in the U3D_LIBDIR environment variable.
Iy you want debug messages add -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake arguments.

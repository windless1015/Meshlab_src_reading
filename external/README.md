# External libraries for MeshLab

Notes about external libraries:

## Required libraries

- GLEW
- easyexif

Without these two libraries (or their relative system provided libraries), MeshLab cannot be compiled.

## Optional libraries

Boost and CGAL directories contain only a portion of the libraries, that is the code necessary to build the `mesh_booleans` plugin.
